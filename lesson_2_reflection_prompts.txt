What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a hidden folder of meta data needed to do all the git related tasks.  You run it back navigating to the folder of your choice then running ‘git init’.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is like the rehearsel before the big show.  It's time to review everything you've done before you commit to the real show.  Time to try new things without repercussions.  Value-wise, you could see what things you've done since the last commit and decide if thats what you want to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
use git diff and git status to see what changes were made.  If two files were altered, then that is more than 1 logical change.  Also if you see many things were changed in the diff, then considered making more frequent and smaller commits.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
